Last week, I passed exam rank 05 with the life question. You can use the code from my repo.

In this exam, I tried the vect_2 and life questions from my repo. The other questions weren't tested on the exam, but I prepared them all carefully. If you'd like to try them on the exam, or if you have, could you share them with me? There may be small errors, so feel free to contact me! You can open an issue or contact me at fatmabetulkeskin4@gmail.com.

About unauthorized use of code from this repo: You can use this code as source. However, taking it directly and sharing it in your own repos is unethical.

If you wish, you can continue using it by forking it. There will be no license, but you can at least give it a star :) I would be very pleased!! <3
